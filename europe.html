	<h3> Eiffel Tower </h3>
	<p>The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: Tour Eiffel [tuʁ ɛfɛl] ⓘ) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the 	Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built 	the tower from 1887 to 1889.
	Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 	World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution. Although initially criticised by 	some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of 	France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 	2022.The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:6.91 million people 	ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World 	Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.
	The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest 	structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the 	Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title 	it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first 	structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a 	broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres 	(17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after 	the Millau Viaduct.
	The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper 	platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the 	European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb 	from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, 	making the entire ascent a 600 step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually 	accessible only by lift. On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use.

	<h3> Palace of Westminster </h3>
	<p>The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is located in 	London, England. It is commonly called the Houses of Parliament after the House of Commons and the House of 	Lords, the two legislative chambers which occupy the building. The palace is one of the centres of political 	life in the United Kingdom; "Westminster" has become a metonym for the UK Parliament and the British Government, 	and the Westminster system of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower of the palace, 	nicknamed Big Ben, is a landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general. The Palace of Westminster has been 	a Grade I listed building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.
	The building was originally constructed in the eleventh century as a royal palace, and was the primary residence 	of the kings of England until 1512, when a fire destroyed the royal apartments. The monarch moved to the 	adjacent Palace of Whitehall, but the remainder of the palace continued to serve as the home of the Parliament 	of England, which had met there since the 13th century. In 1834 a second, larger fire destroyed the majority of 	the palace, but Westminster Hall was saved and incorporated into the replacement palace.
	The competition to design the new palace was won by the architect Charles Barry, who chose a Gothic Revival 	style for the building. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering delays, cost overruns, 	and the deaths of Barry and his assistant, Augustus Pugin. The palace contains chambers for the House of 	Commons, House of Lords, and the monarch, and has a floor area of 112,476 m2 (1,210,680 sq ft).Extensive 	repairs had to be made after the Second World War, including rebuilding the destroyed Commons chamber. Despite 	further conservation work having been carried out since, the palace is in urgent need of major repairs.</p>

	<h3> Tower Bridge </h3>
	<p>Tower Bridge is a Grade I listed combined bascule and suspension bridge in London, built between 1886 and 	1894, designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry with the help of Henry Marc Brunel.It 	crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by 	the City Bridge Foundation, a charitable trust founded in 1282. The bridge was constructed to give better access 	to the East End of London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century. The bridge was 	opened by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894.
	The bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the 	upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping. 	Originally hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. 	The bridge is part of the London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and 	remains an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both 	vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways, and Victorian engine rooms form 	part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.
	Tower Bridge has become a recognisable London landmark.It is sometimes confused with London Bridge, about 0.5 	miles (800m) upstream, which has led to a persistent urban legend about an American purchasing the wrong 	bridge.</p>
