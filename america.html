	<h3> Statue of Liberty </h3
	<p>The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a colossal 	neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the United States. The copper 	statue, a gift from the people of France, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its 	metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.

	The statue is a figure of Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. She holds a torch above her head with her 	right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman 	numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken chain and shackle lie at her feet as she 	walks forward, commemorating the national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War.[8] After its 	dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, being subsequently seen as a symbol of 	welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.

	The idea for the statue was born in 1865, when the French historian and abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye 	proposed a monument to commemorate the upcoming centennial of U.S. independence (1876), the perseverance of 	American democracy and the liberation of the nation's slaves.[9] The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 	1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the people of France finance the statue and the United States provide the 	site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully 	designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.

	The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square 	Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 	work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started 	a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less 	than a dollar (equivalent to $33 in 2022). The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and 	assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked 	by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.

	The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; 	since 1933, it has been maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Statue of Liberty National 	Monument, and is a major tourist attraction. Limited numbers of visitors can access the rim of the pedestal and 	the interior of the statue's crown from within; public access to the torch has been barred since 1916.</p>

	<h3> Yosemite National Park </h3>
	<p>Yosemite National Park (/joʊˈsɛmɪti/ yoh-SEM-ih-tee) is a national park in California.It is bordered 	on the southeast by Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest. The park 	is managed by the National Park Service and covers 759,620 acres (1,187 sq mi; 3,074 km2)in four counties – 	centered in Tuolumne and Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera. Designated a World 	Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, 	giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity.Almost 95 percent of the 	park is designated wilderness.Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the 	Sierra Nevada.

	Its geology is characterized by granite and remnants of older rock. About 10 million years ago, the Sierra 	Nevada was uplifted and tilted to form its unique slopes, which increased the steepness of stream and river 	beds, forming deep, narrow canyons. About one million years ago glaciers formed at higher elevations. They moved 	downslope, cutting and sculpting the U-shaped Yosemite Valley.

	European American settlers first entered the valley in 1851. Other travelers entered earlier, but James D. 	Savage is credited with discovering the area that became Yosemite National Park.Native Americans had 	inhabited the region for nearly 4,000 years, although humans may have first visited as long as 8,000 to 10,000 	years ago.

	Yosemite was critical to the development of the concept of national parks. Galen Clark and others lobbied to 	protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing of the 	Yosemite Grant of 1864 that declared Yosemite as federally preserved land.In 1890, John Muir led a 	successful movement to motivate Congress to establish Yosemite Valley and its surrounding areas as a National 	Park. This helped pave the way for the National Park System.Yosemite draws about four million visitors 	annually.Most visitors spend the majority of their time in the valley's seven square miles (18 km2).The 	park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing five million visitors for the first time.</p>

	<h3> Moraine Lake </h3>
	<p>Moraine Lake is a glacially fed lake in Banff National Park, 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) outside the hamlet of 	Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada. It is situated in the Valley of the Ten Peaks, at an elevation of approximately 	1,884 metres (6,181 ft). The lake has a surface area of 50 hectares (120 acres).

	The lake, being glacially fed, does not reach its crest until middle to late June. When it is full, it reflects 	a distinctive shade of azure blue. The unique colour is due to the refraction of light off the rock flour 	deposited in the lake on a continual basis by surrounding glaciers.

	The road to Moraine Lake is only open during the summer months (June-Sep). Since 2023, Parks Canada has closed 	it for personal vehicles year-round with only its shuttles, public transit and commercial operators allowed to 	access the road. Visitors can also bike the road.
