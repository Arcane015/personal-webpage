In Thailand, they call it Yi Peng – full moon day in 	the second month according to the Lanna lunar calendar.Typically, in November thousands of people gather in 	Bangkok to launch myriads of lantern up into the sky, looking more like swarms of jellyfish floating high in the 	air. It is an extraordinary spectacle even though repeated each year it hardly ever becomes a cliché.</p>
